# ANOTHER RTS

You can play a modified HTML5 version [here](https://jaron-kuijper.itch.io/anotherrts)

Another RTS is a prototype made during school together with a good friend and school buddy of mine [Stan Graafmans](http://Stangraafmans.com). Who due to time constraints that the time couldn't work much on the project itself but has been giving me great suggestions and implemented a few tiny fun things himself (like poking tanks).

The premise behind the rts game is that all tanks are micromachines and are very lightweight. We imagined a tank taking too sharp of a turn and rolling over, where you had to step in and pick them back up again. (It sounded like a fun quirk).

# INTERESTING POINTS
- The game handles keybindings through a yaml file.
- The game supports propper unity grouping and management.
- Units can properly queue commands (despite there only being a move command)
- Camera controls are actually pretty smooth
- I am running out of idea's to say. I should revamp this README more later.
